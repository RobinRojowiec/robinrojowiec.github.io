My name is Robin and I started my career with a Bachelor of Science in Business Information Systems at the HWR Berlin. Then I moved to Munich to specialize in Computational Linguistics at the LMU. I wrote my Masters thesis supervised by [Benjamin Roth](https://www.benjaminroth.net/) at the Center for Information and Language Processing about Simulating Doctor-Patient Interviews using Neural Networks. During this time, I worked as a Cognitive Engineer at IBM. In this role I was responsible for analysing unstructured data and building innovative applications for a variety of natural language processing tasks. This includes on site consulting and project management. In November 2019, I started a sabbactical to work on my PhD thesis at the University of Potsdam, supervised by [Prof. David Schlangen](http://www.ling.uni-potsdam.de/~das/). The PhD research is focused on Communication, Dialogue and Grounding Language. Additionally, I'm intrested in Information Retrieval, Question Answering and Information Extraction.


I'm working with multiple colleagues in [CoLab](http://clp.ling.uni-potsdam.de/) in Potsdam. 
*We use computational methods to investigate communication — the process of making something that was in one head be in more than one head. More specifically, we are interested in multimodal dialogue, where language is the central interaction device, but the body of the participants can be a communication resource as well, and the physical environment can become a topic.* - David Schlangen


My hobbies are climbing, coding, playing video games and cooking. Also, I enjoy listening to a variety of music, mostly centered around rock and electro, and I'm playing the drums for several years.



#### Projects


##### RECOLAGE: Real-Time Vision-Grounded Collaborative Language Generation
Duration: 2019 - 2022<br/>
*The central objective of this project to develop a data-driven model for real-time and collaborative language generationin visually grounded dialogue systems, that maintains a close feedback loop between a user’s non-verbal actions and the system’s verbal actions. This framework will implement an approach to visual and conversational language grounding that is able to package its verbal outputin real-time, and revise it if uncertainty or changes in the world make this desirable.* - David Schlangen, Sina Zarrieß
